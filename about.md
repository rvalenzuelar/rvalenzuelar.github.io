Hello,

I'm Raúl, from Chile. I studied and graduated from Renewable Natural Resources Engineering at Universidad de Chile in 2008. After graduating I worked as Inspector in the General Directorate of Water in the city of Copiapó and then as a Environmental Analysist in Ambimet, in Santiago. I was awarded with a Becas Chile and Fulbright BIO scholarship to start doctorate stduies in 2011. 

I started my PhD at University of Colorado (CU), in the beautiful city of Boulder. During the program I focused in meteorology subjects, developing my dissertation in the study of orographic precipitation along the coast of northern California by using a ground-based X-band Doppler radar. I defended my thesis and graduated in 2016.

Back in Chile in 2017, I started a postdoctoral position at Universidad de Chile, in the Department of Geophysics, where I studied the relationship between atmospheric rivers and extreme daily rainfall y central-southern Chile.

Currently, I'm Assistant Professor at Universidad de O'Higgins in Rancagua, Chile.
